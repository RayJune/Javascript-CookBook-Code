## Javascript Cookbook Code:  
	  
    Thanks to Shelley Powers's brilliant work, for his JavaScript Cookbook. 

    When I practice this book's code, I found some details maybe could be better understand in some different way. So I refactor these code more or less. Mainly did these things:

    * keywords annotation
    * optimize some code in details 
    * use AirBnb ES5 code standard
    * more readable variable name
    * divergent thinking from former code, add a little new demo
    * rename demo's name (naming it use demo's keywords instead of digits)
