## Javascript Cookbook Code:  
  
Thanks to Shelley Powers's brilliant work, for his JavaScript Cookbook. 

When I practice this book's code, I found some details maybe could be better understand in some different way. So I refactor these code more or less. Mainly did these things:

* keywords annotation
* optimize some code in details 
* use airbnb ES5 code standard
* use console.log instead of window.alert
* more readable variable name
* divergent thinking from former code, add a little new demo
* rename demo's name (naming it use demo's keywords instead of digits)
